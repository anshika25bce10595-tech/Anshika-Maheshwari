# Academic tracker
This project is a simple, student-friendly grade and assignment tracker created using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.
Its main goal is to help students stay organized by keeping all their assignments, due dates, and grades in one place.
The program also calculates the student’s GPA automatically and highlights pending or overdue tasks, making academic planning easier.
Using only four standard libraries—statistics, pickle, datetime, and os—the project remains lightweight, easy to run, and beginner-friendly. 
It provides a clean, interactive environment where students can enter data, view reports, and save their progress effortlessly.
